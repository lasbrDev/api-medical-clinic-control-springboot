## Learnings

In this project I was able to further consolidate the concepts of a Rest API, important concepts of architecture standards, mainly Domain Driven Design, which is a watershed in professional projects. I was also able to implement validations in business rules and develop stylish documentation.
The frontend (NextJS) will still be implemented.
